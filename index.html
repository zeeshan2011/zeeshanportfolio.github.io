								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Dashboard.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Adventure Work Report Project<br> load and Transform the data in Microsoft Power BI , Used the Power Query editor to add new Measure columns, so the data can itself represent better.<br> In the Table View find new relationships between different tables and connect the tables using Foreign and Primary Keys.
									<br>Added new Measures using Dax in the Data view, in order to Highlight new Insights from the data. <br>  At last made reports for different categories like
									<ul>
										<li>DashBoard</li>
										<li>Product Details</li>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images\Product Details.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li>Customer Details</li>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images\Customers.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li>Map View</li>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images\Map.png" alt="" /></span>
										<!--<li><a href="#elements">Elements</a></li>-->
									</ul> to better represent the data to get better information from it. <br>Used Dashboard to get useful insights like Total Revenue, Total Profit, Total Returns in the company history and use different filters and slicers to get data like for example from specific timeline or for specific product.
									<br>In Map view highlighted total sales and revenue based on the location, for example which country has the most sales or which region help the company to grow faster.
									<br>Used the Product View to highlight Products behaviours, like which product made the highest revenue or which product end up in higher return rate as compared to others. Used Parameters to showcase different stories using a single line chart and to find out how would a product goest after a change in product price. Used filters to get specific results.
									<br>Customer View is all about showing the insights from our dearest customers. Which Customer has helped us the most in this Journey and how much revenue we made from our customers. Apart from the that I have also included other insights like how much customers belong to a specific occupation and how much the customer is earning on a yearly basis. This Information helped to find the top customers, so the company can offer discounts to that customers.
									<br>Apart from these views, used AI technology to add more insights from data like
									<ul>
										<li>Key Influencers</li>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images\Key Influencers.png" alt="" /></span>
